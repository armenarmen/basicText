  <h1>Ghost Writing</h1>
  <p>
    Lots of people self edit themselves to death their writing dying in the womb.
  </p>
  <p>
    thats why I made this thing, so that a user can write without looking and as a result not be able to over edit too much.  
  </p>
  <p>
    And every day you will be emailed the hsit htat you wrote the day before, raw and unedited. so taht you can see whats up and shit.
